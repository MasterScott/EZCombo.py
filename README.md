A Very Easy way to Load and Choose Combos from a ComboList.

Example:

Lets pretend Comblist.txt contains these lines: 

 example1:Pass1
 
 example2:Pass2
 
 example3:Pass3
 

```python
from lib import EZCombo
ComboIterator = 0
EZCombo.LoadCombos('ComboList.txt')
EZCombo.PullCombo(ComboIterator)
print(EZCombo.Username +':'+EZCombo.Password)
>>>example1:Pass1
```
Remember that lists in python start at 0 and go up!


Quick Usage:

Step 1) Put this file in the same folder as your project, or load it as a package

Step 2) Call the function you want ex: LoadCombos(ComboPath) 

Step 3) Call PullCombo(ComboIterator) to retreive a new Combo. Iterate ComboIterator in your other functions ex: ComboIterator += 1

Thats all.

To Load a Library:

Step 1) Create a folder named "Lib" in your projects directory.

Step 2) Create a file named __init__.py inside of the Lib Folder

Step 3) Put EzCombo.py inside of the Lib folder.

Step 4) import to your python script using from lib import EzCombo
